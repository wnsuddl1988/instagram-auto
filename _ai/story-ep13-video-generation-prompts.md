# 스토리형 13편 (쿠쿠 — 남의 이름으로 만들던 공장이 자기 이름을 건 일, 16장면) 영상 생성 프롬프트 — 수동 진행용

이미지 소스 폴더: `C:/tmp/story-ep13-images/`
영상 저장: **장면 번호로** `C:/Users/PC/Downloads/1.mp4` ~ `16.mp4` (스토리형 13편이라고 알려주기)

생성기: `scripts/build-story-video-generation-prompts.mjs` (TTS: `C:/tmp/money-shorts-os/story-ep13-tts/output-v1/tempo-1.2-gap0.25-pre/elevenlabs-scene-paced-tts-summary.audio-fixed.tempo1.2-gap0.25-pre.json`, 최종 타임라인 66.017초 — 편마다 확정한 템포 기준)

**스토리형 재연 장면 규칙:** 16번 외에는 말하는 인물이 없다(말·입 움직임 전부 금지, 카메라 고정, 인물·사물 동작만). 사용 길이가 7초 이하면 8초 클립, 넘으면 10초 클립(조립 때 장면 길이에 맞춰 자른다). Gemini(Veo)로 배정하는 장면은 길이와 무관하게 항상 10초.
**이 편은 모든 장면에서 화면에 글자·숫자·로고가 없어야 한다**, **영상에 새 간판·숫자·로고가 생기면 반려**.
**얼굴 안전 구간(Owner 2026-10-07):** 영상 위 제목이 세로 18~37%에 계속 떠 있으므로, 영상 생성 결과에서도 인물 얼굴이 위쪽(세로 40% 위)으로 올라오거나 카메라가 움직여 얼굴이 위로 이동하면 반려한다(이미지 구도 그대로 유지).

## s1 — hook (8초, 재연, 사용 6.2초)

```
Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
people, objects and realistic cinematic 3D CG look (natural proportions, smooth CG textures, soft cinematic lighting) and the a factory office wall with a bundle of plain order sheets only half remaining and a hand placing a thick money envelope on the desk in front, hand only, warm but heavy lighting
setting exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any colors, shapes, text,
or object positions except for the motion described below.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 8 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly, no pan,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the hand slides the envelope forward and withdraws, the wall and the sheets stay completely still

NO SPEECH (HIGHEST PRIORITY): nobody in this clip speaks. Every mouth stays closed or
in a natural unspoken expression — no talking, no mouthing words, no singing, no humming, no
lip movement of any kind. The audio track carries only faint natural ambience for the
setting — no voice, no music.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the scene stays visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8
seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds — the described motion keeps going or settles
gently, with natural blinking, breathing, drifting light or dust where relevant. No portion
of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the wall with the half-remaining order sheets, the desk, and the lighting
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object movement,
no props appearing, disappearing, or changing shape.

SCENE LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): no face or body appears — only the hand; the sheets keep no text or numbers; the envelope keeps no logo; the desk stays fixed.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or malformed fingers or hands,
no warped, blurred, flickering, or invented text anywhere in the frame (no new signs, labels, numbers or
logos appearing), no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no background changes, no character or
person redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze mid-motion, no new people entering or leaving unless described, no talking or lip movement, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: a bet in a crisis.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the conveyor frame, the factory walls, and the bright lighting
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object movement,
no props appearing, disappearing, or changing shape.

SCENE LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): no people appear; the boxes keep plain white faces with no text, logos or patterns; the conveyor frame stays fixed.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or malformed fingers or hands,

MOTION DETAIL: the family leans slightly forward as the rice cooker shines on the screen, the sofa and the room stay completely still

NO SPEECH (HIGHEST PRIORITY): nobody in this clip speaks. Every mouth stays closed or
in a natural unspoken expression — no talking, no mouthing words, no singing, no humming, no
lip movement of any kind. The audio track carries only faint natural ambience for the
setting — no voice, no music.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the scene stays visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8
seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds — the described motion keeps going or settles
gently, with natural blinking, breathing, drifting light or dust where relevant. No portion
of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the sofa, the television, and the living room walls
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object movement,
no props appearing, disappearing, or changing shape.

SCENE LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the people stay seen from behind with no face ever shown; the television shows only a plain rice cooker with no text or logos; nobody else enters.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or malformed fingers or hands,
no warped, blurred, flickering, or invented text anywhere in the frame (no new signs, labels, numbers or
logos appearing), no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no background changes, no character or
person redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze mid-motion, no new people entering or leaving unless described, no talking or lip movement, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: on TV.

## s16 — save (10초, 말함, 사용 8.6초)

```
Animate this image into a 10-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
owl character's design and the bright afternoon yard in front of a Korean appliance factory gate with a plain factory building, an open gate, and two pallets of plain white boxes on the ground, smooth light gray pavement
setting exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any colors, shapes, text,
or object positions except for the motion described below.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 10 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly, no pan,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the character gestures gently with one wing at chest height while summarizing, then gives a small warm nod to the viewer; no props are held No props held.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.2s to 8.5s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 8.5s to the very last frame (1.5 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 8.5s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 8.5s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the scene stays visibly alive for the ENTIRE 10
seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds — the described motion keeps going or settles
gently, with natural blinking, breathing, drifting light or dust where relevant. No portion
of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the plain factory building, the open gate, the two pallets of plain white boxes, the smooth light gray pavement, and the warm afternoon light
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object movement,
no props appearing, disappearing, or changing shape.

SCENE LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the factory building and the pallets stay fixed; the sunglasses stay on top of the head; no props are held.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or malformed fingers or hands,
no warped, blurred, flickering, or invented text anywhere in the frame (no new signs, labels, numbers or
logos appearing), no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no background changes, no character or
person redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze mid-motion, no new people entering or leaving unless described, no talking, voice or lip movement after 8.5s, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: warm summary and invitation to follow.
