# 황소특보 16편 (삼성전자 자사주 매입이 끝나면, 진짜 볼 건 실적, 16씬) 영상 생성 프롬프트 — 수동 진행용

이미지 소스 폴더: `C:/tmp/bull-ep16-images/`
영상 저장: **장면 번호로** `C:/Users/PC/Downloads/1.mp4` ~ `16.mp4` (CURRENT_STANDARDS §A-6, "황소특보 16편"이라고 알려주기)

생성기: `scripts/build-video-generation-prompts.mjs` (TTS: `C:/tmp/money-shorts-os/bull-ep16-tts/output-v1/elevenlabs-scene-paced-tts-summary.json`, 타임라인 113.32초)

**★ 2026-09-30 변경 — 입 멈춤 시각(SPEECH TIMING):** 씬마다 "몇 초까지만 말하고 그 뒤엔 입을 다문다"를 넣었다
(표의 '입 멈춤'). 받은 영상에서 입이 그 시각 뒤에도 계속 움직이면 검수에서 표시한다. 눈 깜빡임·호흡은 끝까지 유지.

티어는 8초/10초 두 가지뿐. **소품(카드·보드) 씬은 항상 10초**(2026-10-01 — 8초 클립은 끝에서 글자·소품이 사라짐, 황소 12편 s14). 소품 없는 씬만 발화 8초 미만·여유 1초 이상이면 8초.
**★ 2026-10-01 강화**: SPEECH TIMING을 "구간 2단계(말하는 구간 / 듣는 구간: 입 완전히 닫음·음성 없음)"로 바꾸고 프롬프트 끝에 FINAL REMINDER를 넣었다. 소품 씬엔 "끝 프레임까지 글자 선명, fade/dissolve 금지"를 더했다. 효과는 이 편 검수 때 12편 기준선(15/16 경고, 평균 초과 약 0.9초)과 비교한다.
Gemini(Veo)로 배정하는 씬은 발화와 무관하게 항상 10초(입 멈춤 시각은 그대로).

# 🟦 8초 티어 (s2, s7, s12, s16)
================================================================================

## s2 — opening (8초, open, 입 멈춤 3.0초)

```
Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
gold bull mascot character's design and the bright shareholder-return vault lobby with plain gold coin stacks
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 8 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the character keeps one hand raised with the index finger pointing upward in a confident, friendly gesture while the other hand rests on its hip, smiling brightly and warmly at the viewer. No props held.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 3.0s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 3.0s to the very last frame (5.0 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 3.0s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 3.0s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. No portion of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the large round vault door with a plain wheel handle, the glass display pillars with plain gold coin stacks, the large potted plants, the round benches, and the beige marble floor with a round rug
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 3.0s, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: warmly greeting the viewer.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 3.0s. The last 5.0 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed.
```

## s7 — background (8초, open, 입 멈춤 4.1초)

```
Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
gold bull mascot character's design and the open supply-and-demand balance-scale plaza with plain round marbles
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 8 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the character spreads both hands outward to either side as if weighing two sides, with a calm and clear explanatory expression; no props are held. No props held.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 4.1s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 4.1s to the very last frame (3.9 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 4.1s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 4.1s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. No portion of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the large brass balance scales on round podiums with plain colored marbles, the large potted plants, the low fountain, and the glossy light teal tile floor
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 4.1s, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: calmly showing who sold and who bought.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 4.1s. The last 3.9 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed.

## s12 — counterpoint (8초, open, 입 멈춤 6.9초)

```
Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
gold bull mascot character's design and the bright earnings-announcement stage with a plain blue round backdrop
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 8 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the character rests one hand near its chin with a careful, thoughtful expression and slight head tilts while the other hand rests on its hip; no props are held. No props held.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 6.9s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 6.9s to the very last frame (1.1 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 6.9s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 6.9s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. No portion of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the round podium and long curved stage, the large plain blue round backdrop with no marks, the large potted plants, the rows of round chairs, and the white glossy floor
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 6.9s, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: carefully noting the caveat.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 6.9s. The last 1.1 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed.

## s16 — save (8초, open, 입 멈춤 6.5초)

```
Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 6.5s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 6.5s to the very last frame (1.5 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 6.5s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.

# 🟨 10초 티어 (s1, s3, s4, s5, s6, s8, s9, s10, s11, s13, s14, s15)
================================================================================

## s1 — hook (10초, card2, 입 멈춤 7.2초)

```
Animate this image into a 10-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
gold bull mascot character's design and the bright shareholder-return vault lobby with plain gold coin stacks
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 10 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

PROP LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character holds a card with 2 lines of
large text — "자사주 매입 끝" on the first line, "진짜 볼 건 실적" on the second line — in both hands at chest height. The card
holds steadily at this position for the entire clip, from frame 1 to the
very last frame, and does not move, tilt, rotate, or drift at any point.
Treat the card as a frozen photograph layered in front of the character.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression is intrigued and knowing, eyebrows slightly raised, as if hinting at a twist; body and face move gently while the hands holding the card stay still.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.2s to 7.2s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 7.2s to the very last frame (2.8 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 7.2s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 7.2s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 10 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. The hand(s) holding the card stay steady and in place for the full clip.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the large round vault door with a plain wheel handle, the glass display pillars with plain gold coin stacks, the large potted plants, the round benches, and the beige marble floor with a round rug
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement, no card movement.

CRITICAL TEXT PRESERVATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY): treat the card text ("자사주 매입 끝", "진짜 볼 건 실적") as locked, non-regenerating image layers for the full
10 seconds, including the very last frame. Render them exactly as pixels
copied from the reference image, unchanged frame to frame, still fully
visible and held at the end.
The text must be exactly as dark, sharp and fully readable in the LAST frame as in the FIRST frame.
NO fade-out, NO dissolve, NO cross-fade, NO fade to white, NO washing-out, NO blurring and NO
disappearing of the card or its text at any moment — especially in the final 2 seconds. The clip must
not end with any transition effect; the last frame is a normal frame identical in text to the first.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 7.2s, no card tilt or rotation at any point, no fade, dissolve, wash-out or disappearance of the text or props in the final seconds, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: posing an intriguing question to the viewer.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 7.2s. The last 2.8 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked

no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

PROP LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character holds a card with 2 lines of
large text — "공시한 5,328만 주" on the first line, "이미 다 샀어" on the second line — in both hands at chest height. The card
holds steadily at this position for the entire clip, from frame 1 to the
very last frame, and does not move, tilt, rotate, or drift at any point.
Treat the card as a frozen photograph layered in front of the character.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression is bright and informative with slight nods; only the face and body move while the hands holding the card stay still.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 5.0s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 5.0s to the very last frame (5.0 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 5.0s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 5.0s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 10 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. The hand(s) holding the card stay steady and in place for the full clip.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the large round vault door with a plain wheel handle, the glass display pillars with plain gold coin stacks, the large potted plants, the round benches, and the beige marble floor with a round rug

anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 5.0s, no card tilt or rotation at any point, no fade, dissolve, wash-out or disappearance of the text or props in the final seconds, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: calmly presenting the first number.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 5.0s. The last 5.0 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.

```
Animate this image into a 10-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
gold bull mascot character's design and the bright shareholder-return vault lobby with plain gold coin stacks
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked

no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

PROP LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character holds a card with 2 lines of

holds steadily at this position for the entire clip, from frame 1 to the
very last frame, and does not move, tilt, rotate, or drift at any point.
Treat the card as a frozen photograph layered in front of the character.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression is calm and clear with slight nods; only the face and body move while the hands holding the card stay still.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 6.0s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 6.0s to the very last frame (4.0 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 6.0s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 6.0s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays

STATIC ELEMENTS: the large round vault door with a plain wheel handle, the glass display pillars with plain gold coin stacks, the large potted plants, the round benches, and the beige marble floor with a round rug
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement, no card movement.

CRITICAL TEXT PRESERVATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY): treat the card text ("쓴 돈", "14조 1,565억 원") as locked, non-regenerating image layers for the full
10 seconds, including the very last frame. Render them exactly as pixels
copied from the reference image, unchanged frame to frame, still fully
visible and held at the end.
The text must be exactly as dark, sharp and fully readable in the LAST frame as in the FIRST frame.
NO fade-out, NO dissolve, NO cross-fade, NO fade to white, NO washing-out, NO blurring and NO
disappearing of the card or its text at any moment — especially in the final 2 seconds. The clip must
not end with any transition effect; the last frame is a normal frame identical in text to the first.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 6.0s, no card tilt or rotation at any point, no fade, dissolve, wash-out or disappearance of the text or props in the final seconds, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: calmly presenting the spent amount.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 6.0s. The last 4.0 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.

## s5 — background (10초, card2, 입 멈춤 5.2초)

```
Animate this image into a 10-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
gold bull mascot character's design and the open supply-and-demand balance-scale plaza with plain round marbles
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 10 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

PROP LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character holds a card with 2 lines of
large text — "종료 10월 6일" on the first line, "당초 11월 21일" on the second line — in both hands at chest height. The card
holds steadily at this position for the entire clip, from frame 1 to the
very last frame, and does not move, tilt, rotate, or drift at any point.
Treat the card as a frozen photograph layered in front of the character.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression is serious and clear with slight nods as if announcing a deadline; only the face and body move while the hands holding the card stay still.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 5.2s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 5.2s to the very last frame (4.8 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 5.2s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 5.2s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 10 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. The hand(s) holding the card stay steady and in place for the full clip.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the large brass balance scales on round podiums with plain colored marbles, the large potted plants, the low fountain, and the glossy light teal tile floor
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement, no card movement.

CRITICAL TEXT PRESERVATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY): treat the card text ("종료 10월 6일", "당초 11월 21일") as locked, non-regenerating image layers for the full
10 seconds, including the very last frame. Render them exactly as pixels
copied from the reference image, unchanged frame to frame, still fully
visible and held at the end.

disappearing of the card or its text at any moment — especially in the final 2 seconds. The clip must
not end with any transition effect; the last frame is a normal frame identical in text to the first.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 5.2s, no card tilt or rotation at any point, no fade, dissolve, wash-out or disappearance of the text or props in the final seconds, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: seriously announcing the end date.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 5.2s. The last 4.8 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.

mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 6.3s, no card tilt or rotation at any point, no fade, dissolve, wash-out or disappearance of the text or props in the final seconds, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: confidently delivering the one-line summary.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 6.3s. The last 3.7 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.

## s14 — action (10초, card2, 입 멈춤 7.1초)

```
Animate this image into a 10-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
gold bull mascot character's design and the bright shareholder-return vault lobby with plain gold coin stacks
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 10 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

PROP LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character holds a card with 2 lines of
large text — "① 잠정실적 눈높이" on the first line, "② 하이닉스 종료 뒤" on the second line — in both hands at chest height. The card
holds steadily at this position for the entire clip, from frame 1 to the
very last frame, and does not move, tilt, rotate, or drift at any point.
Treat the card as a frozen photograph layered in front of the character.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression is clear and helpful with slight nods as if listing two things to check; only the face and body move while the hands holding the card stay still.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 7.1s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 7.1s to the very last frame (2.9 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 7.1s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 7.1s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 10 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. The hand(s) holding the card stay steady and in place for the full clip.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the large round vault door with a plain wheel handle, the glass display pillars with plain gold coin stacks, the large potted plants, the round benches, and the beige marble floor with a round rug
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement, no card movement.

CRITICAL TEXT PRESERVATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY): treat the card text ("① 잠정실적 눈높이", "② 하이닉스 종료 뒤") as locked, non-regenerating image layers for the full
10 seconds, including the very last frame. Render them exactly as pixels
copied from the reference image, unchanged frame to frame, still fully
visible and held at the end.
The text must be exactly as dark, sharp and fully readable in the LAST frame as in the FIRST frame.
NO fade-out, NO dissolve, NO cross-fade, NO fade to white, NO washing-out, NO blurring and NO
disappearing of the card or its text at any moment — especially in the final 2 seconds. The clip must
not end with any transition effect; the last frame is a normal frame identical in text to the first.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 7.1s, no card tilt or rotation at any point, no fade, dissolve, wash-out or disappearance of the text or props in the final seconds, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: clearly listing two things to check.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 7.1s. The last 2.9 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.

MOOD: warmly reassuring the viewer.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 7.9s. The last 2.1 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.
