# 스토리형 12편 (디즈니 — 이름을 숨기고 사 모은 땅, 16장면) 영상 생성 프롬프트 — 수동 진행용

이미지 소스 폴더: `C:/tmp/story-ep12-images/`
영상 저장: **장면 번호로** `C:/Users/PC/Downloads/1.mp4` ~ `16.mp4` (스토리형 12편이라고 알려주기)

생성기: `scripts/build-story-video-generation-prompts.mjs` (TTS: `C:/tmp/money-shorts-os/story-ep12-tts/output-v1/tempo-1.2-gap0.25-pre/elevenlabs-scene-paced-tts-summary.audio-fixed.tempo1.2-gap0.25-pre.json`, 최종 타임라인 85.282초 — 편마다 확정한 템포 기준)

**스토리형 재연 장면 규칙:** 16번 외에는 말하는 인물이 없다(말·입 움직임 전부 금지, 카메라 고정, 인물·사물 동작만). 사용 길이가 7초 이하면 8초 클립, 넘으면 10초 클립(조립 때 장면 길이에 맞춰 자른다). Gemini(Veo)로 배정하는 장면은 길이와 무관하게 항상 10초.
**이 편은 모든 장면에서 화면에 글자·숫자·로고가 없어야 한다**, **영상에 새 간판·숫자·로고가 생기면 반려**.
**얼굴 안전 구간(Owner 2026-10-07):** 영상 위 제목이 세로 18~37%에 계속 떠 있으므로, 영상 생성 결과에서도 인물 얼굴이 위쪽(세로 40% 위)으로 올라오거나 카메라가 움직여 얼굴이 위로 이동하면 반려한다(이미지 구도 그대로 유지).

## s1 — hook (8초, 재연, 사용 4.5초)

```
Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
people, objects and realistic cinematic 3D CG look (natural proportions, smooth CG textures, soft cinematic lighting) and the a 1960s Orlando morning diner table with an opened plain newspaper and one person seen from behind looking down at the front page showing only a map-like pattern, morning sunlight through the window
setting exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any colors, shapes, text,
or object positions except for the motion described below.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 8 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly, no pan,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the person smooths the newspaper with one hand and leans a little closer, the table and the window stay completely still

NO SPEECH (HIGHEST PRIORITY): nobody in this clip speaks. Every mouth stays closed or
in a natural unspoken expression — no talking, no mouthing words, no singing, no humming, no
lip movement of any kind. The audio track carries only faint natural ambience for the
setting — no voice, no music.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the scene stays visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8
seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds — the described motion keeps going or settles
gently, with natural blinking, breathing, drifting light or dust where relevant. No portion
of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the table, the opened newspaper, and the diner window
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object movement,
no props appearing, disappearing, or changing shape.

SCENE LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the people stay seen from behind with no face ever shown and do not resemble any real person; the newspaper keeps only plain map patterns with no text or numbers; nobody else enters.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or malformed fingers or hands,
no warped, blurred, flickering, or invented text anywhere in the frame (no new signs, labels, numbers or
logos appearing), no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no background changes, no character or
person redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze mid-motion, no new people entering or leaving unless described, no talking or lip movement, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: a strange article.

seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the hand finishes the signature and lifts the pen, the desk and the document stay completely still

NO SPEECH (HIGHEST PRIORITY): nobody in this clip speaks. Every mouth stays closed or
in a natural unspoken expression — no talking, no mouthing words, no singing, no humming, no
lip movement of any kind. The audio track carries only faint natural ambience for the
setting — no voice, no music.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the scene stays visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8
seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds — the described motion keeps going or settles
gently, with natural blinking, breathing, drifting light or dust where relevant. No portion
of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the large desk, the document, the pen cap, and the warm light
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object movement,
no props appearing, disappearing, or changing shape.

SCENE LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): no face or body appears — only the hand; the document keeps no readable text; the desk stays fixed.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or malformed fingers or hands,
no warped, blurred, flickering, or invented text anywhere in the frame (no new signs, labels, numbers or
logos appearing), no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no background changes, no character or
person redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze mid-motion, no new people entering or leaving unless described, no talking or lip movement, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: permission to confirm.

Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
owl character's design and the bright afternoon on a wide lawn plaza with a round fountain, low flower beds, distant ride tracks and one hot air balloon, no castle, towers, flags, map panels, characters or text, smooth light gray pavement, warm afternoon light
setting exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any colors, shapes, text,
or object positions except for the motion described below.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 8 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly, no pan,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the character gestures gently with one wing at chest height while summarizing, then gives a small warm nod to the viewer; no props are held No props held.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.2s to 5.2s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 5.2s to the very last frame (2.8 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 5.2s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 5.2s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the scene stays visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8
seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds — the described motion keeps going or settles
gently, with natural blinking, breathing, drifting light or dust where relevant. No portion
of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the round fountain, the flower beds, the distant ride tracks, the smooth light gray pavement, and the warm afternoon light
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object movement,
no props appearing, disappearing, or changing shape.

SCENE LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the fountain and the tracks stay fixed; no castle, tower, flag or text appears; the sunglasses stay on top of the head; no props are held.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or malformed fingers or hands,
no warped, blurred, flickering, or invented text anywhere in the frame (no new signs, labels, numbers or
logos appearing), no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no background changes, no character or
person redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze mid-motion, no new people entering or leaving unless described, no talking, voice or lip movement after 5.2s, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: warm summary and invitation to follow.
