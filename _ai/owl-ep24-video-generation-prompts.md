# 부엉박사 표시 23편(파일 ep24) (군 복무와 출산, 국민연금 더 인정돼요, 15씬) 영상 생성 프롬프트 — 수동 진행용

**번호 주의: 이 파일의 "표시 23편" = 파일명·폴더의 ep24.**
이미지 소스 폴더: `C:/tmp/owl-v2-ep24-images/`
영상 저장: **장면 번호로** `C:/Users/PC/Downloads/1.mp4` ~ `15.mp4` (CURRENT_STANDARDS §A-6, "부엉박사 표시 23편(파일 ep24)"이라고 알려주기)

생성기: `scripts/build-video-generation-prompts.mjs` (TTS: `C:/tmp/money-shorts-os/owl-ep24-tts/output-v2/elevenlabs-scene-paced-tts-summary.json`, 타임라인 107.72초)

**★ 2026-09-30 변경 — 입 멈춤 시각(SPEECH TIMING):** 씬마다 "몇 초까지만 말하고 그 뒤엔 입을 다문다"를 넣었다
(표의 '입 멈춤'). 받은 영상에서 입이 그 시각 뒤에도 계속 움직이면 검수에서 표시한다. 눈 깜빡임·호흡은 끝까지 유지.

티어는 8초/10초 두 가지뿐. **소품(카드·보드) 씬은 항상 10초**(2026-10-01 — 8초 클립은 끝에서 글자·소품이 사라짐, 황소 12편 s14). 소품 없는 씬만 발화 8초 미만·여유 1초 이상이면 8초.
**★ 2026-10-01 강화**: SPEECH TIMING을 "구간 2단계(말하는 구간 / 듣는 구간: 입 완전히 닫음·음성 없음)"로 바꾸고 프롬프트 끝에 FINAL REMINDER를 넣었다. 소품 씬엔 "끝 프레임까지 글자 선명, fade/dissolve 금지"를 더했다. 효과는 이 편 검수 때 12편 기준선(15/16 경고, 평균 초과 약 0.9초)과 비교한다.
Gemini(Veo)로 배정하는 씬은 발화와 무관하게 항상 10초(입 멈춤 시각은 그대로).

# 🟦 8초 티어 (s2, s6, s7, s14, s15)
================================================================================

## s2 — opening (8초, open, 입 멈춤 3.1초)

```
Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
owl mascot character's design and the bright glass greenhouse guidance hall
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 8 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the character raises one wing slightly in a friendly greeting while the other wing hangs naturally, smiling calmly and warmly at the viewer; no props are held. No props held.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 3.1s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 3.1s to the very last frame (4.9 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 3.1s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 3.1s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. No portion of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the round glass dome structure, the tall round-leaf plants, the round wooden benches, the large potted plants, and the light sky-blue tile floor with a round green rug
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 3.1s, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: warmly greeting the viewer.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 3.1s. The last 4.9 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed.
```

## s6 — fact (8초, open, 입 멈춤 4.9초)

```
Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
owl mascot character's design and the bright time-path exhibition hall
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 8 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression is clear and steady while one wing extends forward as if pointing to a date ahead and the other wing hangs naturally; no props are held. No props held.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 4.9s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 4.9s to the very last frame (3.1 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 4.9s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 4.9s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. No portion of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the round stepping-stone path, the large plain hourglass models without any marks, the round moon-shaped sculptures, the round potted plants, and the glossy light lavender floor
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 4.9s, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: clearly stating when it starts.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 4.9s. The last 3.1 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed.

## s7 — core_question (8초, open, 입 멈춤 6.0초)

```
Animate this image into an 8-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
owl mascot character's design and the bright terraced fruit garden
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 8 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression starts curious with a slight head tilt and turns confident while one wing lifts in an explaining gesture and the other hangs naturally; no props are held. No props held.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 6.0s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 6.0s to the very last frame (2.0 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 6.0s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 6.0s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 8 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. No portion of the clip should hold a single frozen pose for more than half a second.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the round terraced hills, the round trees with plain golden round fruit models, the round flower beds, the round potted plants, and the warm light-green lawn with a round stone path
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 6.0s, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: confidently giving the key answer.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 6.0s. The last 2.0 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed.

# 🟨 10초 티어 (s1, s3, s4, s5, s8, s9, s10, s11, s12, s13)
================================================================================

## s1 — hook (10초, card2, 입 멈춤 5.5초)

```
Animate this image into a 10-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
owl mascot character's design and the bright glass greenhouse guidance hall
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 10 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

PROP LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character holds a card with 2 lines of
large text — "군 복무 기간" on the first line, "전부 인정" on the second line — in both hands at chest height. The card
holds steadily at this position for the entire clip, from frame 1 to the
very last frame, and does not move, tilt, rotate, or drift at any point.
Treat the card as a frozen photograph layered in front of the character.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression is wide-eyed and curious, eyebrows raised, as if revealing a surprising change to the viewer; only the face and body move while the wings holding the card stay still.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.1s to 5.5s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 5.5s to the very last frame (4.5 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 5.5s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 5.5s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 10 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. The hand(s) holding the card stay steady and in place for the full clip.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the round glass dome structure, the tall round-leaf plants, the round wooden benches, the large potted plants, and the light sky-blue tile floor with a round green rug
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement, no card movement.

CRITICAL TEXT PRESERVATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY): treat the card text ("군 복무 기간", "전부 인정") as locked, non-regenerating image layers for the full
10 seconds, including the very last frame. Render them exactly as pixels
copied from the reference image, unchanged frame to frame, still fully
visible and held at the end.
The text must be exactly as dark, sharp and fully readable in the LAST frame as in the FIRST frame.
NO fade-out, NO dissolve, NO cross-fade, NO fade to white, NO washing-out, NO blurring and NO
disappearing of the card or its text at any moment — especially in the final 2 seconds. The clip must
not end with any transition effect; the last frame is a normal frame identical in text to the first.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 5.5s, no card tilt or rotation at any point, no fade, dissolve, wash-out or disappearance of the text or props in the final seconds, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: posing a surprising question to the viewer.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 5.5s. The last 4.5 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.

Animate this image into a 10-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
owl mascot character's design and the bright glass greenhouse guidance hall
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any

no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

PROP LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character holds a card with 2 lines of
large text — "보험료 안 내도" on the first line, "가입기간 인정" on the second line — in both hands at chest height. The card
holds steadily at this position for the entire clip, from frame 1 to the
very last frame, and does not move, tilt, rotate, or drift at any point.
Treat the card as a frozen photograph layered in front of the character.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression is clear and friendly with slight nods, as if explaining what a credit is; only the face and body move while the wings holding the card stay still.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 7.4s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 7.4s to the very last frame (2.6 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 7.4s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.

natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. The hand(s) holding the card stay steady and in place for the full clip.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the round glass dome structure, the tall round-leaf plants, the round wooden benches, the large potted plants, and the light sky-blue tile floor with a round green rug

not end with any transition effect; the last frame is a normal frame identical in text to the first.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or

anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze

## s4 — fact (10초, card2, 입 멈춤 8.1초)

```
Animate this image into a 10-second video clip. STYLE CONSISTENCY: keep the
owl mascot character's design and the bright time-path exhibition hall
background exactly as shown in the reference image. Do not change any
colors, text, or object positions.

CAMERA LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the camera is completely static and locked
for the ENTIRE 10 seconds — absolutely no zoom in, no zoom out, no dolly,
no framing drift, not even a slow or subtle one, including the final 1-2
seconds. The framing at frame 1 and the framing at the very last frame must
be pixel-for-pixel identical in scale and crop.

PROP LOCK (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character holds a card with 2 lines of
large text — "국민연금법" on the first line, "국회 통과" on the second line — in both hands at chest height. The card
holds steadily at this position for the entire clip, from frame 1 to the
very last frame, and does not move, tilt, rotate, or drift at any point.
Treat the card as a frozen photograph layered in front of the character.

MOTION DETAIL: the character's expression is serious and clear with slight nods, as if announcing that the law passed; only the face and body move while the wings holding the card stay still.

SPEECH TIMING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — this overrides every other instruction about the mouth and the voice):
PHASE 1, from 0.0s to 8.1s: the character speaks. The mouth actively opens and
closes in a natural speech rhythm — never closed-mouth talking.
PHASE 2, from 8.1s to the very last frame (1.9 seconds): the character is LISTENING, not speaking.
The lips are fully closed and gently pressed together in a soft closed-mouth smile,
and the jaw does not move at all. NO speech, NO syllables, NO mumbling, NO humming,
NO vocal sounds, NO lip movement and NO mouth shapes of any kind. The audio track
after 8.1s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 8.1s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 10 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. The hand(s) holding the card stay steady and in place for the full clip.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the round stepping-stone path, the large plain hourglass models without any marks, the round moon-shaped sculptures, the round potted plants, and the glossy light lavender floor
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement, no card movement.

CRITICAL TEXT PRESERVATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY): treat the card text ("국민연금법", "국회 통과") as locked, non-regenerating image layers for the full
10 seconds, including the very last frame. Render them exactly as pixels
copied from the reference image, unchanged frame to frame, still fully
visible and held at the end.
The text must be exactly as dark, sharp and fully readable in the LAST frame as in the FIRST frame.
NO fade-out, NO dissolve, NO cross-fade, NO fade to white, NO washing-out, NO blurring and NO
disappearing of the card or its text at any moment — especially in the final 2 seconds. The clip must
not end with any transition effect; the last frame is a normal frame identical in text to the first.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 8.1s, no card tilt or rotation at any point, no fade, dissolve, wash-out or disappearance of the text or props in the final seconds, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: seriously announcing the law change.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 8.1s. The last 1.9 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.

after 6.1s contains only faint room ambience — no voice at all. The eyes keep
blinking and the head gives slow, small nods, as if waiting for the viewer's reaction.
Even if the character seems to be in the middle of a word at 6.1s, finish that word
and close the mouth immediately. Hold PHASE 2 until the very last frame.

CONTINUOUS MOTION FOR THE FULL CLIP (HIGHEST PRIORITY): the character stays
visibly alive for the ENTIRE 10 seconds, including the last 2-3 seconds —
natural eye blinks every 2-3 seconds, subtle breathing and body bounce,
gentle head movement. Only the mouth follows the SPEECH TIMING above. The hand(s) holding the card stay steady and in place for the full clip.

STATIC ELEMENTS: the round glass dome structure, the tall round-leaf plants, the round wooden benches, the large potted plants, and the light sky-blue tile floor with a round green rug
must stay completely fixed — no camera pan or zoom, no background object
movement, no card movement.

CRITICAL TEXT PRESERVATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY): treat the card text ("군복무와 출산이", "연금에 더 반영") as locked, non-regenerating image layers for the full
10 seconds, including the very last frame. Render them exactly as pixels
copied from the reference image, unchanged frame to frame, still fully
visible and held at the end.
The text must be exactly as dark, sharp and fully readable in the LAST frame as in the FIRST frame.
NO fade-out, NO dissolve, NO cross-fade, NO fade to white, NO washing-out, NO blurring and NO
disappearing of the card or its text at any moment — especially in the final 2 seconds. The clip must
not end with any transition effect; the last frame is a normal frame identical in text to the first.

NEGATIVE PROMPT: no face distortion, no proportion drift, no extra or
malformed fingers, no warped, blurred, flickering, or misspelled text
anywhere in the frame, no regenerated or reinterpreted signage, no
background changes, no character redesign, no abrupt cut or freeze
mid-motion, no talking, voice, mumbling or lip movement after 6.1s, no card tilt or rotation at any point, no fade, dissolve, wash-out or disappearance of the text or props in the final seconds, no camera zoom, crop, or framing drift at any point.

MOOD: confidently delivering the one-line summary.

FINAL REMINDER (read this last): the voice and all mouth movement STOP at 6.1s. The last 3.9 seconds are silent, with the mouth closed, and the card text stays fully visible until the final frame.

## 완료 후 절차
1. `C:/Users/PC/Downloads/1.mp4`~`15.mp4`(파일럿은 `{n}b.mp4`)로 저장하고 "부엉박사 표시 23편(파일 ep24) 영상 검수해줘"라고 알려주기
2. 검수: 길이·시작/중반/끝 프레임·글자 보존·카메라 + `scripts/check-clip-speech-timing-once.mjs`로 입 멈춤 시각 측정
3. 재생성이 필요한 씬은 같은 프롬프트로 다시 뽑는다. 글자 소실·입 멈춤 불이행은 위 강화 문구가 이미 들어 있으니 더 덧붙이지 말고 결과를 기록한다(효과 측정용)
